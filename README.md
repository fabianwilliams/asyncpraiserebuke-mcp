# ü§ñ AsyncPraiseRebuke MCP Server

**AsyncPraiseRebuke-MCP** is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.dev) server that exposes business feedback and contact discovery tools ‚Äî including AI agent-based flows ‚Äî for integration with Claude Desktop or any other MCP-compliant client.

## üîç What It Does

This server powers tools that can:

- ‚úÖ List and search customer feedback reviews  
- ‚úÖ View top-rated and lowest-rated establishments  
- ‚úÖ Discover business contact emails using scraping and heuristics  
- ‚úÖ Log new entries to a Cosmos DB-based directory  
- ‚úÖ Chain tool logic with agents that automate multi-step flows  

## üß© Available Tools

### Core Tools (Stateless & Reusable)

These can be used individually for focused functionality:

- \`listPublicReviews\` ‚Äì Get all public feedback entries  
- \`getTopRatedLocations\` ‚Äì View top and bottom rated businesses  
- \`searchReviews\` ‚Äì Search reviews by partial business name  
- \`searchBusinessDirectory\` ‚Äì Look up existing business entries in Cosmos DB  
- \`logBusinessEmail\` ‚Äì Add a business contact email manually  
- \`discoverBusinessEmail\` *(from ClicknContact)* ‚Äì Discover emails and form fields from business websites  

### üß† Agent Tool: \`discoverAndLogBusinessEmail\`

This agentized tool automates the entire workflow:

1. Calls ClicknContact to discover contact info  
2. Checks your Cosmos DB directory to prevent duplicates  
3. Logs new businesses with placeholder values if needed  

**Tool name:** \`discoverAndLogBusinessEmail\`  
**Source:** \`ClicknContactScannerAgent\`
